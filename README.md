A Simple Constant Current Load
==============================

This is a simple implementation of a constant current load that many
in the past have implemented, many are probably better than this one
but a constant current load can bring up lots of interesting issues
and OpAmp stability is one of them.

This work is not novel or unique and as such I cannot claim any
originality, it is just an implementation of something many have
done before me. Please use it as you wish.
